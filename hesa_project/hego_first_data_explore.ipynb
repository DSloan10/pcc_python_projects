    "1. A breakdown of which subjects provide particularly high salaries for graudates and which provide lower. Take general results from across the UK and then use subject-ranking data to isolate areas where UoD is currently well-placed to create graduates that recieve higher pay once they enter the labour market. \n",

    "2. An examination of which characteristic groups are less likely to enter higher paid work on average. Suggestions on how such individuals can be supported to a greater degree upon graduation. \n",
